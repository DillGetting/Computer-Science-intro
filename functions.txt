look at the problem and identify the peices that you can solve.
make function for average and test it, then move on with the problem,

breaking apart your code,

def myf(parameter list)
    body of the function here

The Stack:
    everytime you make a call to a function it is placed on the stack.

pass by value
    just the value is passed
    or pass by object if mutable
pass by reference
    can append the list
    lists dictionary are mutable.

returning values is the primary way to get something out of a function
it differs from a print in that

can help with everything

implicit aconversion
def add(a, b):
return a +b
add(1,2) == 3
add(1.0,

can create a test function before you write the code before you write the function.
