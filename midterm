pip installs python stuff
system path needed to use the system executibles like python. as the executable.
    needs to be on path for the computer to see that "python" is a keyword for executing
    any python stuff.
local path and system path are usually the same.

stdio
stddraw
stdarray
    know those at the basic level
know what types are mutable and immutable.
    str, int floats and bool are immutable but can be reassigned.
variable name vs memory
    object references
type conversions


conditional stuff
    basic if syntax:
LOOPING
    understand the loop variable
    while x = 10
        x += 1
print(x)

variable scope
    global vs local vs more local
        where conflicts could happen
    for i in range():
        i is the internal local variable.
        only can be used in the indected section
        < points towards the input
        > points the other way these only work in linux
        use get-content in windows.
        or piping |
            closes something and smoked the pipe
Writing functions
    parameters or arguments
    return values
        can have multiple returns that is a tuple that python can decide what is does.
    side effects
        immutable vs immutable.
    local and global scope.
        funtions do only one thing,
Modules
    the reason for using them
        to use in other programs
    imports
        import at the top like import sys
        or
        from x import y
        import x as z
        from x import * is he same as the standard import <thing>
going to have to write functions or scripts basically
there will be some errors that you must know what it means
he is hard.
we like to get hard but not as hard as vic cuase he is really hard
like so hard bitch fuckyeah right yeah bitch fucking hard as god damn rocks over hear
